# OctoPrint Cinnamon Applet

This is a simple Cinnamon panel applet that shows your current OctoPrint job status.

## Installation

Just clone this repository to your Cinnamon applets directory at `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`

`git clone https://github.com/fehlfarbe/octoprint-applet ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/octoprint@fehlfarbe`

You can setup your OctoPrint URL and API key in the settings menue (right click on the applet). It also supports basic authentification.

## Bugs?

Please open a Issue and append your `.xsession-errors` logfile ( `cat ~/.xsession-errors` )

## ToDo:

- show printer state (temperature etc.)
- add progress bar?
- add to official Cinnamon applet repo
- add webcam image for popup
- add icon
